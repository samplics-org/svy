# svy

Modern Python tools for **complex survey analysis**, built for real-world statistical workflows.

**svy** is a rigorously design-based yet production-oriented ecosystem for survey design, weighting, estimation, and small area estimation — without sacrificing transparency or scalability.

## ⚠️ Repository Purpose (Please Read)

This repository is currently the **public coordination and feedback hub** for the **svy ecosystem**.

- 📘 **Documentation is live**
- 🧪 **Code is under active preparation and will be published here shortly**
- 🐞 **Issues, questions, and feedback are welcome now**

The repository is intentionally public early to:

- collect feedback from early users,
- track issues and feature requests,
- coordinate development across the svy ecosystem.

If you are looking for usage details, tutorials, or theory notes, please start with the documentation.

## What is svy?

svy is designed for people who **actually work with complex survey data**, including:

- National statistical offices
- Public health and development programs
- Survey methodologists
- Data scientists working with complex samples

The focus is **correct inference first**, with APIs that fit naturally into modern Python workflows.

## Key Capabilities (Planned & In Progress)

- Complex survey design (strata, clusters, weights)
- Design-based estimation with valid standard errors
- Replication methods (BRR, bootstrap, jackknife)
- Small Area Estimation (area- and unit-level models)
- Explicit, inspectable, reproducible outputs
- Integration with pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and JAX-based tooling
